## Horiseon Website Changes

## Goal

```
The client requested a codebase that follows accessibility standards 
so that their site is optimized for search engines.

```

## Scope of Work

```
In order to meet their goals our client gave us the following 5 requirements:
•	When the source code is viewed, Semantic HTML elements must be used. 
•	When viewing the structure of the HTML elements, must find that elements 
    follow logical structure independent of styling and positioning
•	All img elements should include accessible alt attributes
•	Heading attributes must fall in sequential order
•	The Title element must include a concise, descriptive title

Additionally, the website must remain the same visually as this screenshot:

![Assignment1Website](assets\images\01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

```
## Met requirements by the following:

```
•	When the source code is viewed, Semantic HTML elements must be used.
- 	Changed <div> correcting to the Semantic HTML elements that must be used to 
        follow accessibilty standards 
        Example: ![Assignment1Website](changed-div-semantic.JPG)

        follow logical structure independent of styling and positioning
